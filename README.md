## Getting Started

If you're new to contributing to open-source projects, don't worry! Here's how you can get started:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the PETARI repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Petari.git
    ```

3. **Open project**: Open the project directory.

    ```
    cd Petari
    ```

4. **Create a new branch**: To create a new branch for your profile, run the following command:

    ```
    git checkout -b add-profile
    ```

5. **Setting up Project**: Once you are in the Project directory, run this command to install all necessary npm modules

    ```
    npm install
    ```

6. **Setting up dotenv file**: In the Project directory, create a file named ".env". Now add the following data to it

    ```
    PORT=3000
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = youraccesstokensecret
    MAIL_ID = yourmailid
    PASS_ID = your gamil app password 
    ```

7. **Database**: If MongoDB is not installed on your local machine, install it. Once you run the project, databases and collections will be automatically created. For installation, you can follow the installation manual given on the MongoDB website for your respective operating system:

    [MongoDB Installation Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

    Once installation is done, open your terminal:
    - If you have installed MongoDB as a service, run this command to open the  MongoDB Shell:
    
        ```
        mongosh  
        ```
    
    - Otherwise, you can run MongoDB Community Edition from the Windows command     prompt instead of as a service. Open the command prompt, navigate to the    MongoDB directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin`),     and run this command:
    
        ```
        mongod
        ``` 
    
      This will start the MongoDB service. Don't close this terminal window     while you are working on the project. Now run this command to open the  MongoDB Shell in a new command prompt window/tab:
    
        ```
        mongosh  
        ```

    Once MongoDB is running as a service, proceed to the next step.

8. **Running The Project On Local Machine**: To run the project, navigate to the project directory. Now run the command:  

    ```
    nodemon app.js 
    ```

    If the above command gives an error, run this command:

    ```
    npx nodemon app.js
    ```

    Once the server starts listening, to render the webpage, go to:

    ```
    http://localhost:${PORT_MENTIONED_IN_DOTENV} or http://localhost:3000
    ```

9. **Checking Database**: After running the project for the first time, databases and collections will be automatically created. To check if they are properly made, open the MongoDB Shell and run these commands:

    ```
    show dbs
    ```

    You will find a database named `PetariDB`. Now, run this command in the MongoDB Shell to use that database:

    ```
    use PetariDB
    ```

    To check collections inside the PetariDB, run this command in the MongoDB Shell:

    ```
    show collections
    ```

    You will see 4 collections inside the PetariDB: `admins`, `ngos`, `queries`, `users`.
    
10. **Make Changes**: Make your desired changes to the codebase or documentation.

11. **Test Your Changes**: Test your changes locally to ensure everything works as expected.
