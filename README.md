# PETARI (The Food Donate WebApp) : -

Petari is an organization that aims to redistribute excess food from weddings, parties, and events to those who are hungry. We aim to bring benefits across the spectrum of society and help provide access to food to those who donâ€™t have adequate means to access it. Petari is working in alignment with India's Sustainable Development Goals for making the World Hunger Free and Zero Food Waste. In addition to its important economic and societal impact, food waste places undue pressure on finite natural resources and the environment.
